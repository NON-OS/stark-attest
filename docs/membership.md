# Membership attestation: the trailer

The product of this crate, as consumers experience it, is the trailer: a
self-contained byte string an artifact carries, proving under a 32-byte root
that this exact artifact, with this exact context, is a member of the
enrolled set. This page is the wire format, the statement, and the verifier's
parse, from `src/air/attest_trailer.rs`, `attest_build.rs`, `attest_verify.rs`
and `multi_membership.rs`.

## The statement

The enrolled set is committed as a Merkle tree of the in-circuit Poseidon
(width 8, see [hashing.md](hashing.md)) over the members' measurements, padded
to the fixed width `2^depth` with a reserved slot value that begins with a
byte no real artifact starts with, so no artifact can measure into a padding
leaf. The root is the 32-byte statement.

## How a member is measured, and the choice that costs a thousandfold

A leaf is the Poseidon digest of a member. There are two ways to reach it, and
the crate offers both because they bind different things:

**Direct** (`measure_capsule`, `MeasuredSet::commit`) absorbs the artifact's
bytes into the sponge, seven per lane with a permutation every rate group, so
one permutation per 28 bytes. The proof binds the bytes themselves. Measured on
this crate's own study, that runs at about three megabytes a second, and the
rate is flat in artifact size: a hundred megabyte release spends more than half
a minute in the sponge before any proving starts.

**Hybrid** (`measure_capsule_hybrid`, `MeasuredSet::commit_hybrid`) hashes the
artifact with BLAKE3 and absorbs only the resulting 32 bytes, one permutation
regardless of size. It reaches BLAKE3's own throughput, three and a half
gigabytes a second, which is over a thousand times the direct path at a
megabyte and grows with artifact size.

The security difference, stated plainly: the hybrid binds a BLAKE3 digest where
the direct path binds the bytes, so a BLAKE3 collision would let two artifacts
share a leaf. Whether that is a new assumption depends on the caller. For an
attestation whose proof context already carries the artifact's BLAKE3
measurement, as this crate's does, a BLAKE3 collision already breaks binding
regardless of how the leaf was built, so the hybrid removes redundant work
rather than adding a hypothesis. A caller whose context commits to no
general-purpose digest is making a real trade and should keep the direct path.

The two are domain separated: the hybrid absorbs a fixed domain word before the
digest, so no artifact measures to the same leaf under both schemes, the roots
differ, and a trailer from one never verifies against the other. That is
deliberate. Changing how a set is measured has to invalidate the set rather
than silently reinterpret it.

A trailer for member `i` proves: *I know the authentication path from leaf `i`
to this root, and the proof is bound to this context.* The context is
`BLAKE3(artifact) || caller bytes` (in the OS deployment the caller bytes are
the granted capability mask and the policy epoch). Binding happens in the
STARK transcript, so the same path proven for a different context is a
different proof and fails verification. One verification therefore checks
three things at once: membership under the root, the artifact's exact bytes
(through the measurement in the context), and the issuer's chosen metadata.

## Wire format

```
offset  size                 field
0       8                    magic "NZKSTRK1"
8       1                    depth (tree depth; 0 is invalid)
9       ceil(depth/8)        direction bits, LSB-first per level
+       depth * RATE * 8     sibling digests, RATE=4 field elements each,
                             u64 little-endian, each < p (canonical)
+       rest                 the serialized STARK proof
```

The parse (`verify_attestation_trailer`) is strict and total: magic checked,
depth bounds checked, every sibling element rejected unless canonical
(`v < p`), lengths validated before any slice, and the function is
`#[must_use]` so a consumer cannot accidentally drop the verdict. Malformed
input returns false; nothing panics on any byte string.

## What the trailer cannot claim

The soundness parameters are not in the trailer. The verifier supplies the
round count, query count, grind and blowup from
[the parameter authority](params.md); the source states the rule as the
design intent: the counts are the verifier's, never the trailer's, so a
prover cannot weaken the low-degree test by handing over a proof that claims
an easier one. A trailer proven under weaker parameters simply fails against
a verifier demanding the real ones.

## Enrollment

`attest_build.rs` builds trailers; the `MeasuredSet` type commits the padded
set once and issues every member's trailer from that single commitment, so
enrolling `n` members costs one tree plus `n` proofs rather than `n` trees.
Every emitted trailer is immediately re-verified by the same gate the
consumers run, so a trailer that would fail in the field fails at enrollment
instead.

Trailers embed grinding nonces, so re-enrollment of an identical set produces
byte-different trailers proving identical statements. Nothing may compare
trailers by hash across enrollments; identity lives in the root and the
statement, not the proof bytes.

## Set semantics

One root commits one set. Any member change moves the root and invalidates
every trailer, and there is no sound shortcut that keeps sibling proofs alive
under a new root, because their authentication paths run through changed
nodes. That is the semantics of a set commitment; the operational answer is
to re-enroll on release, not to iterate under proof (see the consumer's build
documentation for the two-loop workflow this implies).
